# 11/12/2021 - A few thoughts
Game On, Allow me to Rebuttle!

1. How far down the hypervisor rabbit hole do we go? because I'm all for building out a distributed system that learns the most successful configuration from previous experience and predicts the most successfull 'relative_network' of nodes relative to the 'requesting node'.

2. Where is the training data coming from? There might be a record ofa single distributed systems performance over x years, but if not we should have a standard in place for generating continuous and uncontinuous data to be sure the network is comfortable not only with gradual, continuous changes in network bandwidth, but also for sudden outages / (re)introduction of nodes into the system.
### Data
The data schema for a neural network friendly record of how the network performed with the nodes around it will need to store data about the nodes themselves, the paths between them, and possibly most importantly, a precompiled configuration of

to handle dynamic networks (a distributed system where a new node being added, an old node being removed, or the ) there should be a screenshot of the network as a whole or the nodes explored as a part of a combined map for the network to relate nodes to one another.

### Scoring
Stability
Consistency (same as stability?)
success in future predictions
